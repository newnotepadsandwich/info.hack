- Script injection protection in all dynamic content

### ⚡ **Rate Limiting**
- Button click rate limiting (1-second minimum between actions)
- Download request throttling (2-second minimum)
- Suspicious activity detection and logging

### 🏷️ **Script Verification**
- Digital signatures for script integrity
- Source code availability verification
- Security ratings for each script
- Permission declarations

### 🔐 **Secure Download Process**
1. **Security Warning Modal**: Users see detailed security information
2. **Permission Review**: Clear display of what the script can access
3. **Source Code Access**: Direct link to view source before installation
4. **Integrity Verification**: Hash checking for script authenticity

## 🏦 **GCash Integration Security**

### Safe Payment Processing
- **No Direct Processing**: QR code display only, no direct payment handling
- **Manual Verification**: Encourages users to message after payment
- **Secure QR Display**: Image served from local assets, not external APIs
- **Privacy Protection**: No payment information stored locally

### GCash Security Features:
- Modal-based QR display prevents right-click saving
- Clear instructions for safe payment verification
- Warning about verifying transactions manually
- No automatic payment processing or tracking

## 🚨 **Security Monitoring**

### Client-Side Protection
- **CSP Violation Reporting**: Automatic reporting of security policy violations
- **Console Tampering Detection**: Monitors for debugging attempts
- **Rapid Click Detection**: Identifies automated/bot behavior
- **DOM Integrity Checks**: Ensures page hasn't been modified maliciously

### Security Event Logging
All security events are logged for analysis:
- Download attempts and completions
- Security warning dismissals
- Donation link clicks
- Suspicious activity detection

## 📋 **Security Checklist for Users**

### Before Installing Scripts:
- [ ] ✅ Script shows "Verified" security badge
- [ ] 🔍 Review the security warning modal completely
- [ ] 👀 Click "View Source" to inspect the code
- [ ] 📖 Read the permissions list carefully
- [ ] 🏆 Check the safety rating (5 stars = safest)
- [ ] 🕒 Verify the last update date

### Safe Installation Process:
1. **Read Security Warning**: Don't skip the security modal
2. **Check Permissions**: Understand what the script can access
3. **Review Source Code**: Click the GitHub link to view code
4. **Install from Official Source**: Only use provided download links
5. **Monitor Behavior**: Watch for unexpected activity after installation

## 🔧 **For Developers: Adding New Scripts Securely**

### Required Security Metadata:
```javascript
{
    verified: true,              // Manual verification required
    scriptHash: "sha256-...",    // Integrity hash
    safetyRating: 5,             // 1-5 star rating
    permissions: ["none"],       // Tampermonkey permissions
    matches: ["*://game.com/*"], // URL patterns
    lastSecurityCheck: "2024-01-21"
}
```

### Script Security Requirements:
1. **Code Review**: All scripts must be manually reviewed
2. **Permission Justification**: Document why each permission is needed
3. **Source Availability**: Code must be publicly viewable
4. **Update Notifications**: Users notified of security-relevant updates
5. **Revocation System**: Ability to mark scripts as unsafe

## 🚀 **Deployment Security**

### Recommended Hosting:
- **HTTPS Only**: Never serve over HTTP
- **CDN Security**: Use reputable CDN with integrity checks
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies current
- **Backup Strategy**: Secure backups of all script files

### Server Security Headers:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: [see index.html for full policy]
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## 📊 **Security Metrics Dashboard**

Track these security metrics:
- Number of verified scripts vs total scripts
- Security warning modal completion rates
- Source code click-through rates
- Reported security incidents
- User feedback on script safety

## 🆘 **Incident Response Plan**

### If a Malicious Script is Discovered:
1. **Immediate Removal**: Remove from website immediately
2. **User Notification**: Display warning banner
3. **Revocation Notice**: Mark as unsafe in script metadata
4. **Investigation**: Document how the script bypassed security
5. **Process Improvement**: Update security measures

### Reporting Security Issues:
- Email: security@your-website.com
- GitHub Issues: For code-related security concerns
- Response Time: 24 hours for critical issues

## 🔄 **Regular Security Maintenance**

### Monthly Tasks:
- [ ] Review and update all script security ratings
- [ ] Check for new security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Update CSP policies if needed
- [ ] Review security logs for patterns

### Quarterly Tasks:
- [ ] Full security audit of all scripts
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Test incident response procedures
- [ ] Review and update security headers

## 🎯 **Quick Security Setup**

1. **Enable All Security Headers** (already done in index.html)
2. **Use HTTPS Only** for hosting
3. **Regular Script Review** process
4. **Monitor Security Events** in analytics
5. **Keep Dependencies Updated**

This implementation provides multiple layers of security while maintaining a good user experience. Users are informed about security without being overwhelmed, and developers have clear guidelines for maintaining security standards.
